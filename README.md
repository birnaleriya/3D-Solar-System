## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 Realistic **3D planets** with actual textures
- 🌀 Planetary **self-rotation** and **revolution around the sun**
- 🔁 **Speed controls** for individual planets (via sliders)
- 🛑 **Pause/Resume** the entire animation
- ✨ **Starry background** simulating space
- 🧭 Visible **orbit paths** for each planet
- 🖱️ **Click to zoom** on any planet
- 💡 **Hover tooltips** displaying planet name, size, and distance
- 🌓 **Dark/Light theme** toggle for better user experience
